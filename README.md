# Salon Shop Appointment Booking System

**Description:**  
This project is a command-line application for a salon appointment booking system. The app uses a shell script to interact with users, ask for their details, and schedule appointments in a PostgreSQL database. The application is designed to handle basic booking needs for a salon, offering services such as cutting, washing, and a complete service. The SQL script initializes the necessary database schema and tables for storing customer and appointment data.

## Features

- **Service Selection:** Users can choose between various salon services (Cutting, Washing, or Complete).
- **Customer Management:** The system checks for existing customers by phone number and prompts new users to enter their details.
- **Appointment Scheduling:** Users can select a time for their appointment, which is then saved in the PostgreSQL database.
- **Data Storage:** Customer and appointment data is stored in the PostgreSQL database for future reference.
